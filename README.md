# Happiness Study

What factors affect an entire population's overall happiness? Due to my interest in data science as well as human psychology, I have decided to look into the various socioeconomic, political, and geographical factors that affect overall happiness of a country's population. Using a dataset from Kaggle, my goal is to extract meaningful conclusions to gain a better understanding of how humans respond to various living conditions, and what can be done to improve on a global scale.

One of my first questions when looking at the data was "Does geographical location have any impact on a population's happiness score?". To explore this, I created a chloropleth map using Python's plotly library to get a visual representation of the geographical distribution of happiness scores.

Other questions to consider:
- How do politics and government impact a population's happiness?
- Is a booming economy enough or can other factors negate the positive effect of comfortable living conditions?
- Do countries with the highest life expectancy also have the highest happiness scores? 
- How does culture impact a population's happiness regardless of geographical location, politics, and economy?
